# Mastodon's Values

## 1. We put people first.

- We are building a human-centred social web, where authentic connections matter more than metrics.
- We prioritise genuine human interactions, champion user privacy, and make decisions that benefit people rather than profits.

## 2. We build bridges, not walls.

- We empower communities to connect, while maintaining their autonomy.
- Through decentralisation, we create pathways for diverse groups to interact on their own terms, fostering understanding across different perspectives and cultures.

## 3. We believe in open dialogue about our decisions, processes, and challenges. 

- Our code is open source, our policies are public, and our decision-making welcomes community input.
- When we make mistakes, we acknowledge them and make things right.

## 4. We are transparent and trustworthy.

- We reject centralised control and corporate influence to create a platform that evolves according to community needs.
- Through community-driven funding and development, we demonstrate that social media can flourish without compromising its values.

## 5. We are part of a movement.

- We are part of a diverse ecosystem working toward a better internet.
- Our strength comes from collaboration, shared knowledge, and mutual support across the decentralised web movement.
